## **Container Orchestration Features**

*Kubernetes:* Kubernetes offers a robust set of features for container orchestration. Pods, the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, encapsulate containers and share the same network namespace. Kubernetes ensures efficient pod and node management, allowing for seamless scaling of applications horizontally. Service discovery and load balancing are intrinsic to Kubernetes, enabling effective communication between microservices. Additionally, Kubernetes provides rolling updates and rollbacks, ensuring minimal downtime during application updates. Health checks and self-healing mechanisms contribute to the overall reliability of applications.

*Amazon ECS:* Amazon ECS, as a container orchestration service provided by AWS, offers features tailored to the Amazon ecosystem. Task and cluster definitions define the deployment and scaling of containerized applications. Similar to Kubernetes, ECS provides service discovery and load balancing capabilities. Deployment strategies, such as rolling updates and blue-green deployments, offer flexibility in managing application updates. Health checks and auto-scaling contribute to the robustness of ECS-managed applications.

### **Code Examples - Kubernetes**

1. **Deploying a Sample Application:** Create a Kubernetes Deployment YAML file, e.g., `nginx-deployment.yaml`:
    
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: nginx-deployment
    spec:
      replicas: 3
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: nginx
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: nginx
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: nginx
            image: nginx:latest
            ports:
            - containerPort: 80
    ```
    
    Apply the deployment:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml
    ```
    
2. **Exposing the Deployment:** Create a service YAML file, e.g., `nginx-service.yaml`:
    
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: nginx-service
    spec:
      selector:
        app: nginx
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 80
          targetPort: 80
      type: LoadBalancer
    ```
    
    Apply the service:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f nginx-service.yaml
    ```

### **Code Examples - Amazon ECS**

1. **Creating a Task Definition:** Create an ECS task definition, e.g., `nginx-task.json`:
    
    ```json
    {
      "family": "nginx-task",
      "containerDefinitions": [
        {
          "name": "nginx-container",
          "image": "nginx:latest",
          "essential": true,
          "portMappings": [
            {
              "containerPort": 80,
              "hostPort": 80
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    
    Register the task definition:
    
    ```bash
    ecs-cli compose --file nginx-task.json create
    ```
    
2. **Running the Task:** Run the task:
    
    ```bash
    ecs-cli compose up
    ```
    
3. **Accessing the Service:** Retrieve the public IP address of the ECS EC2 instance:
    
    ```bash
    ecs-cli ps
    ```
    
    Access the running NGINX service using the IP address and port 80.
